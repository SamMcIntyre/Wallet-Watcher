This is an iOS app I am designing to budget for a short time when internet would not be reliable. An example of such time is a cruise or any such vacation. It allows you to set a budget and then add expenses as they happen. 

Expenses can automatically keep track of tax and gratuity according to what the user sets as well. There will also be a QuickAdd feature for expenses that are recurring and likely cost the same amount (like drinks from a bar, etc.)

It is currently in an unfinished state, but will be properly working soon.
